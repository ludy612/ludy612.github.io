Hello! I’m **Ludan Yang**, a PhD student in Second Language Studies at Indiana University Bloomington.

My research explores how languages are **acquired, maintained, and sometimes lost** across the lifespan. I’m especially interested in:

- **Foreign language attrition** – how and why foreign languages are "lost" in adult learners.
- **Sentence processing and the brain** – experimental and EEG work on how learners interpret expressions in new languages.
- **Learner corpora and lexical development** – tracking changes in lexical diversity, fluency, and sophistication in longitudinal learner corpora.

When I’m not doing research, I enjoy learning different languages, drawing, painting, and good music.

You can find more details on my **[Publications](/publications/)**, **[Talks](/talks/)**, and **[Teaching](/teaching/)** pages.
